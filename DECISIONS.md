# Fuaran.DB — decisions (newest first)

## 2026-10-03 — D1: the repository

**Decided by the operator, 2026-10-03.** The domain gets a repository of its own, private for now, in the
organisation that holds the data vertical.

1. **Private, and authored to public standard from the first commit.** No private project, product or
   workspace name appears in any file or commit message. The licence is not yet chosen; choosing it, and any
   change of visibility, are separate and deliberate acts.
2. **The workspace baseline.** `main` from the first commit; F# 10 on .NET 10, the SDK pinned in
   `global.json`; Fantomas pinned as a local tool; `run.ps1` at the root as the one-command entry point and
   `verify.ps1` as the gate. Until the solution exists, `run.ps1` states that nothing was built or tested.
3. **The design decisions are not restated here yet.** The domain's proposed decisions (the dataset model as
   the artefact, no second query language, a pure provider, policy before lowering, the connection record,
   read-only first) are recorded here as each lands with the code that implements it.
